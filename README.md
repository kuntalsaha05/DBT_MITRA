🌟 DBT Mitra – Enhancing Student Awareness on Aadhaar & DBT

🚀 A Smart India Hackathon (SIH25059) solution to bridge the awareness gap between Aadhaar-linked and DBT-enabled Aadhaar-seeded bank accounts.

📌 Problem Statement

This project aims to solve this awareness gap through an interactive, multilingual, gamified platform.
